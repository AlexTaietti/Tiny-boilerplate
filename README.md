# Tiny boilerplate

This is some boilerplate code I use for tiny frontend experiments, useful to quickly test ideas live in the browser. This set up allows you to use SASS and ES6, it also includes a live-reload feature thanks to `browser-sync`. Simply clone this repo, run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` and start coding!
